features of plugin(the respitory named plugin), and more!

lets you see health bars when you hit a mob

hitting iron golems on top of a pillar has a chance of the iron golem destroying the blocks under you

hitting zombies, husks, ect. on top of a pillar has a chance of them calling for backup and summoning a spider or a skeleton

features in progress: nightly attacks of mobs (centered around your bed/respawn point), mining has higher risks (silverfishyish type threat?), can't build around spawners, and iron golems don't spawn in water (no more easy iron farms!(because they feel like cheesing the game)) (possibly, maybe other way)
